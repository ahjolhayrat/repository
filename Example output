    "AbstractLabel": " Abstract Human germ cells perpetuate human genetic and epigenetic infor- mation However , the underlying mechanism remains elusive , due to a lack of appropriate experimental systems Here , we show that human primordial germ cell-like cells ( hPGCLCs ) derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells ( hiPSCs ) can be propagated to at least ~106-fold over a period of 4 months under a defined condition in vitro During expansion , hPGCLCs maintain an early hPGC-like transcriptome and preserve their genome-wide DNA methylation profiles , most likely due to retention of maintenance DNA methyltransferase activity These characteristics contrast starkly with those of mouse PGCLCs , which , under an analogous condition , show a limited propagation ( up to ~50-fold ) and persist only around 1 week , yet undergo cell-autonomous genome-wide DNA demethylation Importantly , upon aggregation culture with mouse embryonic ovarian somatic cells in xenogeneic-reconsti- tuted ovaries , expanded hPGCLCs initiate genome-wide DNA demethylation and differentiate into oogonia/gonocyte-like cells , demonstrating their germline potential By creating a paradigm for hPGCLC expansion , our study uncovers critical divergences in expansion potential and the mechanism for epigenetic reprogram- ming between the human and mouse germ cell lineage",

    "IntroductionLabel": " Introduction The germ cell lineage ensures the continuity and the generation of diversity of genetic as well as epigenetic information across the generations , thereby serving as a foundation for the perpetuation and evolution of a given species In humans , anomalies in germ cell development result in critical diseased states , including infertility and genetic and epigenetic disorders of offspring Thus , investiga- tions into the mechanism of germ cell development constitute a fundamental theme both in biology and in medicine Accordingly , the mechanism of mammalian germ cell development has been a subject of intensive study using the mouse as a model organism ( Lesch & Page , 2012 ; Saitou & Miyauchi , 2016 ) On the other hand , until now , the mechanism for human germ cell development has been largely elusive , due to a difficulty in analyzing human germ cell development and a lack of appropriate experimental systems ( Saitou & Miyauchi , 2016 ; Tang et al , 2016 ) Recent studies have demonstrated an in vitro reconstitution of germ cell development in mice In this in vitro system , mouse pluripotent stem cells ( mPSCs ) , including embryonic stem cells ( mESCs ) and induced pluripotent stem cells ( miPSCs ) , cultured under a \u201c na\u0131\u00a8ve \u201d pluripotent state , are induced into epiblast-like cells ( EpiLCs ) and then into primordial germ cell-like cells ( mPGCLCs ) , which contribute to spermatogenesis upon transplantation into the testes of neonatal mice ( Hayashi et al , 2011 ) or upon aggregation with embryonic testicular somatic cells ( reconstituted testes ) followed by spermatogonial stem cell-like cell derivation and trans- plantation into the testes of adult mice ( Ishikura et al , 2016 ) More- over , mPGCLCs contribute to oogenesis upon aggregation with embryonic ovarian somatic cells ( reconstituted ovaries : rOvaries ) followed by transplantation under the ovarian bursa or an appropri- ate in vitro culture ( Hayashi et al , 2012 ) The resultant spermatozoa and oocytes generate healthy offspring ( Hayashi et al , 2011 , 2012 ) In addition , a methodology for the in vitro propagation of mPGCLCs with the use of forskolin and rolipram , which stimulate the intracel- lular production of cyclic AMPs ( cAMPs ) , has been developed ( Ohta et al , 2017 ) Under this condition , mPGCLCs undergo epigenetic reprogramming , including genome-wide DNA demethylation , most likely in a replication-coupled , passive manner , and acquire an epigenetic \u201c blank slate \u201d , an immediately precursory state for sexu- ally dimorphic development ( Seisenberger et al , 2012 ; Ohta et al , 2017 ) Consequently , based on this in vitro system , the key signals 1 Institute for the Advanced Study of Human Biology ( ASHBi ) , Kyoto University , Kyoto , Japan 2 Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology , Graduate School of Medicine , Kyoto University , Kyoto , Japan 3 Center for iPS Cell Research and Application ( CiRA ) , Kyoto University , Kyoto , Japan 4 AMED-CREST , AMED , Tokyo , Japan 5 Medical-risk Avoidance Based on iPS Cells Team , RIKEN Center for Advanced Intelligence Project ( AIP ) , Kyoto , Japan * Corresponding authormed kyoto-u ac jp \u00aa 2020 The Authors The EMBO Journal 39 : e104929 | 2020 1 of 25 The EMBO Journal Yusuke Murase et al and the underlying mechanisms for the female sex determination et al , 2017 ; of Nagaoka et al , 2020 ) germ cells have been clarified ( Miyauchi These advances have been serving as the basis for an in vitro reconstitution of human germ cell development "
